=========================
How it works?
Simple! 
1. I didn't download jquery.min.js amongst a few other things so you pretty much need the internet to preview --- even the flickr api needs the internet.
2. Just download the css,js and fonts folders as well as the index.html file.
3. You are good to go.
4. Enjoy....
